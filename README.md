# Local Development
## Prerequisites
- Node 16 - BEWARE the old version, this is what's supported on morph.io. See `nvm` if you need to be able to switch between versions. 
- Visual Studio Code - Highly recommended as your editor for build in type checking. 

## Getting Started
In a terminal, run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
This will run the scraper whenever you save a change to a file. 

Edit the `.ts` files in the `src` directory to make changes. These are TypeScript files that are "compiled" to JavaScript files in the `build` directory.
